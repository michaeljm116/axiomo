* Trying to fix alert all bees but
	* trying to figure out how to not use global state for it
	* so when
	* uhg
	* ultimately, character flags should be more like... animation flags
	* and game flags adescribe the game actions 
	* so question is how to alert all bee's during a game flag
	* also keep in mind that it'll eventually go away
	* unless you have a sophisticated grid-based way to see if a bee see's you
		* aka not via raycast
		* a LOS player eyes to bee sphere would be pretty simple
		* but it would be less predictable
	* I think when character is running you should just give them a run game flag
	* and when the animation end the flag ends...
		* the flag should be handled in the player code itself?

## Next mechanic
* Just log eveyrthing as bugs and figure out the next mechanic hmmm
* I'd really like the attack system revamped dice are horribad
* but no lets think about LOS or Obstacles
*
