So you got dodge v1 done just needs some gameplay adjustments and tweaky tweaks now you need to do Line of sight

# Line of Sight
* So ultimately atleast for now there's a `visibility` flag you plan on adding
* `visibility` will be based on whether a player can see a bee or a bee can see a player
* There's a question then about whether it should be done via raycasting or nah
* raycasting SEEMS like the simplest solution but also the least testable and hardest to control
* along with visibility there needs to be direction tracking
* with `visibility` there's question about like... if you can't see a bee can you see the bee
* Another thing is `direction` which the character would (probably alreayd does) need to have
