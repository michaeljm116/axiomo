Plan:
* ~~Edit Mode: Press button to end battle~~
* Fix Animation Bug
	* Ensure proper endings can work
* Make it so if battle ends you start overworld from the right
	* And you can't go back to that battle
* Flying, Grounded Mechanics
* Add Status Effects

### Issue
* gpu memory is possibly leakable? its not in an arena
* but its managed in teh render system itself but yeah not safe
*
