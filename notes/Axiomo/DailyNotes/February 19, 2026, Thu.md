Dodge mode is broken
if you miss, the arrow stays on screen
basically its not done cause there's no like death system maybe?

due to the 2 moves... you never alert be when you stop on him but go back

debugging this is difficult i think its time to officially create the visual grid and then add certain features liek being able to see the brensham line

this may involve transparency and more shader work

also possibly giving every grid an entity
or a Maybe(entity)
