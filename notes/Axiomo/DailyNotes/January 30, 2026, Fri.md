So right now there's a couple things you're working on 
1. Refactoring the movement system
2. Refactoring the input/controller system

## Movement: 
* actually you should do input first
* 

## Input:
* right now you just kind of hardcode individual key presses
* you should have a system similar to your previous engine
* have a generic controller interface that you use in the game
* but in the engine it can capture the keypresses etc
* maybe also have a game controller like
	* Action Button
	* Select Button
	* Back Button
* Then just ya know... do stuff
*
