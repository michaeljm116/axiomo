* YOu noticecd a werid bug when trying to lplay a thing and now idk what do 
	* you were stuck in a permanent move state
	* what could cause that?
	* some kind of lack of refresh between kills
* Also chests no longer open
* bee is not alerted when on top of player... why?
	* nvm, they are alerted but the visual isn't there
* Chest don't activate 
	* or work
* Bee can go to left of level in 1 turn
* clear bee kill = nope
