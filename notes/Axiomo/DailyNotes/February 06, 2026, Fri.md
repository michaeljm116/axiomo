* YOu noticecd a werid bug when trying to lplay a thing and now idk what do 
	* you were stuck in a permanent move state
	* what could cause that?
	* some kind of lack of refresh between kills
	* ## UPDATE, the controller state was wonky it should be secure now needs testing tho
* bee is not alerted when on top of player... why?
	* nvm, they are alerted but the visual isn't there
	* ## Update, be alerts are pretty wonky and inconsistent still needs a revamp based on current ves event system also just add a ticket
* Chest don't activate 
	* or work
		* ## UPDATE: FIXED
* Bee can go to left of level in 1 turn
* clear bee kill = nope
* okay i want the action, dice suck!
	* so it alerts during bee_action_move_towards
	* is overlapping necessary?
	*
