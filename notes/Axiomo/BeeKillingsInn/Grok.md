  

Hi, I'm making a game called bee killings inn and im going to use the odin programming language. Right now I'm trying to create a rules engine for the game. I've made a paper prototype of the game and im now going to implement it. I'd like data structures for all the weapons, caharcters and actions. here's some notes:  

## Aesthetics

- Main Feeling = On Edge
- Story, a bee has entered your house its like a huge wasp and you know you need to kill it in order to sleep at all tonight but you're sooo scared but yeah you need to kill it

## Dynamics

- Sneaking up to 🐝
- Zeroing in on 🐝
- Swinging at  🐝
- Focus on movement of 🐝
- while flying
- on wall
- on surface
- on ceiling
- Running away from 🐝
- Looking for 🐝
- Looking for Weapons
- 🐝Looking for light
- Looking for food
- Flying around randomly
- Looking for attacker
- Stinging the attacker
- Stinging when feeling threatened
- Dodging player attacks

## Mechanics

- Move
- Sneak
- Run
- Fly
- Idle
- Crawl
- Look:
- Up/Down
- Left/Right
- Zoom
- In/Out
- Action
- Swing
- Dodge
- Sting
- Fly
- Weapons
- Shoe
- FlySwatter
- Electric Fly Swatter
- SprayCan
- Hand
- Characters
- Bee
- Wasp
- Player
- Maths
- HP
- Accuracy
- Distances

## Rules

- You start off seeing the bee

## Improvements

- Make bee's remove looks more frequently
- Mutiplyaer, especially for the card portion
- Move movement
- Maybe make a treasure chest with a
- Let the bee go first
- more fun started happening when that happened

### Your 10 games

- There's no point in keeping multiple runs
- double runs are kinda dumb tbh
- the bee doing nothing is kinda boring
- but it does capture the reality of prepping to kill a bee
- sneak move 1' are always a must
- It's fun when movement is happening
- you were confident when you had a very good card
- Bug Spray with multi dodges is fun!
- Electric swatter is op
- electric swatter always leads to runs
- Yo that fly swatter oh man that game was intense
- there was like a mixture of so many strategies to employ and realizing you made the wrong decision
- that bee moving away and destroying your spacing o man...
- You got rid of the shoe and went with the swatter... despite the fact that if you have multi dodges... the shoe would have been a good strat tooo...
- Kinda boring game after...
- you assembled a shoe withi a look +2 and then was like k got everything time to move and yeah just not so interesting even tho t echnically you had a good chance of dying if the shoe missed
- The problem with run is... you only use that when you know you're going to run and kill the bee
- actually that might be an okay thing.... it's like a combo card of sorts that makes it so if you attak you only attack once per turn
- it's just.. dumb to alert the bee before an attack and thats why you keep winning

## Ideas

- multi bee turns
- muti player
- remove elec swat or more focus on weap strats
- bee needs more move forwards, more of that than backwards
- fly twoard shoudl be UP to 2 closer

#### Wins

Me, Be, Me, Me, Me, Me, Me, Me, Me, Me

## Bee + 2 cards see

#### Aggressive

- movement is more fun
- player strategy changes to be more defensive
- 2nd win was purely luck you should have died... unless...
- technically it wasn't luck since you strategized you'd have less stings
- should resuffling be mandatory?
- i think it makes it more strategic to not reshufflie
- running on aggressive bees is useless might as well stay still and build up
- Auto alert when on top is gr8
- The grounds only are kinda boring... you should do something more like... 8 on ground 10 on air or something Wins: me, me, me, bee, me

## 2 Bees, each 1 card based on personality

1 aggressive, 1 defensive bee, bee

## 3 bees, 2 players

1 aggressive, 1 lazy, 1 other

- trading?
- should all bees be alerted?
- remove looks upon hit?
- - 2 must remove
- weapon on hand?
- equip weapon = 1 turn?
- overall... game is longer, less exciting, more everything
- aggressive bee is fun tho... like the beginning is fun
- maybe making players life harder is more fun
- equip = 1 turn
- no trading
- remove looks upon hit
- rename look to focus
- all bees get alerted

## Grid Bee

- The worst part about the previous game was there not being much movement
- so now that's solved
- another problem was no uses for run until the end
- with line of sight that can be solved
- this also adds more strat
- I think I'm liking it so far
- issue is... it seems less.. fun?
- That part where you're constantly wondering what move the bee will make next is...
- fun!
- on edge!
- One thing is though... it's like... too.... balanced
- actually nvm you can't say that
- balance is good but it just... doesn't let you feel POWERFUL
- And then its like... okay you have a 50% chance of killing 1 bee.. what aobut 2?
- impossible!
- maybe make it so that if you kill 1 bee you level up your weapon
- but honestly... you haven't really tested out 2 players yet
- In the mean time... tech wise... i think a grid is a go!
- i wish i can odin this but...
- like honestly it's disgusting   Also here's a sample playthrough:
- Clear Grid
- Set as 7 x 5 (w,h)
- Place player at (0,2)
- Place bee at (6,2)
- Shuffle Bee Deck
- Randomly place weapons upside-down on grid
- On Level 1, place 2 random weapons at (2,0) and (4,3)
- Player Moves to (1,2)
- Bee draws (2) cards from deck
- both are Sting if alerted: (is not alerted so do nothing)
- Player Moves to (2,2)
- Bee Draws from deck
- Another sting-if-alerted, but also a crawl-away.
- because its an (attack bee) it chooses sting-if-alerted and does nothing
- Player moves down to (2,1)
- Bee Draws from deck
- Fly-twoard(move 2 closer) and Fly-away(move 2 away)
- because its an attack bee it moves 2 closer to player
- Player goes to to weapon (2,0)
- Note: it's still undecided if i want the player on top of weapon to take it, or just next to weapon to take it. or even, 1 turn for being on weapon and one for equipping the weapon but for now if the player is on top of the weapon, they take it
- Player now has weapon
- Weapon is NewsPaper, does full damage when be is on ground, half when bee is flying, 8+ accuracy
- Bee Draws from deck
- same set up
- 2 closer to player
- Player takes 1 turn to Look at bee
- Accuracy +1
- Bee draws from deck
- Crawl-toward : move 1 closer, is grounded and Fly-Away
- Chooses crawl toward, Bee is now 1 away from player at (2,1)
- Player is in range of bee
- Player chooses to attack bee
- Player rolls a 4 but needs a 7
- Bee is alerted due to player attack
- Bee draws from deck
- Same set up as before
- crawl toward but can't since it is 1 away from player
- does nothing but is still grounded
- Player attacks bee and hits with an 8
- Player wins
- Advance to Level 2   Please help me plot out all the data structures and the flow of how the rules engine would be in odin programming language using the latest odin standards

Thought for 2m 11s

### Data Structures in Odin

I'll start by outlining the key data structures based on your game notes, sample playthrough, and mechanics. Odin is a systems programming language with a focus on simplicity, so I'll use structs for complex types, enums for variants (like weapon types or actions), and slices/arrays for dynamic collections (e.g., decks, grids). I'll assume the latest Odin standards (as of 2025, including features like core:slice for better slice handling, but keeping it compatible with core Odin).

Key assumptions from your notes:

- Grid is 2D (width x height, e.g., 7x5), with positions as (x, y) where x is column (0 to width-1), y is row (0 to height-1).
- Weapons have properties like accuracy, damage modifiers (e.g., full on ground, half in air), and possibly range.
- Characters: Player (human-controlled), Bee/Wasp (AI via deck draws).
- Actions: Player has free-form choices (move, look, attack); Bee draws from a deck of cards, choosing based on personality (e.g., aggressive prefers toward moves).
- Bee states: Alerted (triggers stings), Grounded/Flying.
- Game state includes levels, multiple bees, HP, accuracy bonuses from "looks" (renamed to focus?).
- Distances: Manhattan or Euclidean? I'll use Manhattan (abs(dx) + abs(dy)) for grid simplicity, but you can adjust.
- Deck: Shuffled slice of BeeAction structs; draw N cards (e.g., 2 for aggressive), choose one based on rules.
- Weapons: Picked up when on tile (as per sample); no equip turn for now, but you can add.
- Maths: HP (start with e.g., 1 for bee, more for player?), accuracy (roll vs threshold), distances for ranges.

I'll define enums and structs below. Use package main for a top-level file, and import core libs like core:math/rand for shuffling/rolls, core:slice for slices.

### Flow of the Rules Engine

The rules engine can be a set of procedures in Odin that manage game initialization, turns, and resolution. It's turn-based: Player acts first (as per sample), then bee(s). Use a main loop for simulation, or expose procs for a UI/game loop.

1. **Initialization** (setup proc):
    
    - Create GameState.
    - Alloc grid: state.grid = make([][]Tile, GRID_HEIGHT); for &row in state.grid { row = make([]Tile, GRID_WIDTH) }
    - Place player at (0,2), bee at (6,2) for level 1.
    - Init characters: Player hp=START_PLAYER_HP, accuracy_bonus=0, weapon=None.
    - Bee: hp=START_BEE_HP, personality=.Aggressive, alerted=false, is_flying=true (starts flying?).
    - Shuffle bee_deck.
    - Randomly place weapons: Pick 2 from weapons_pool, place at random empty positions (e.g., (2,0), (4,3)).
    - For multi-bee: Add more bees with different personalities.
    
    Example proc:
    
    odin
    
    `   init_game :: proc() -> GameState {  state: GameState  state.rng = rand.create(123) // Seed for repro  state.weapons_pool = init_weapons()  state.bee_deck = init_bee_deck()  // Alloc grid...  state.player = { .Player, {0,2}, START_PLAYER_HP, 0, { .None,0,0,0,0,0 }, false, .Aggressive, false, false } // Personality irrelevant for player  state.bees[0] = { .Bee, {6,2}, START_BEE_HP, 0, { .None,0,0,0,0,0 }, false, .Aggressive, true, false }  state.num_bees = 1  state.level = 1  // Place weapons randomly  positions := []Vec2i{{2,0}, {4,3}} // Or rand  for pos, i in positions {  w_idx := rand.int31_max(i32(len(state.weapons_pool)), &state.rng)  state.placed_weapons[pos] = state.weapons_pool[w_idx]  state.grid[pos.y][pos.x] = { .Weapon, state.weapons_pool[w_idx] }  }  return state  }       `
    
2. **Player Turn**:
    
    - Input or simulate PlayerAction (e.g., from UI: Move to new pos, Look to +1 accuracy, Attack target bee).
    - Validate: Can't move off grid, collision check (bees block?).
    - Move: Update position. If on weapon tile, pickup: if tile.type == .Weapon { player.current_weapon = tile.weapon; tile.type = .Empty }
    - Sneak: Move without alerting (if dist >1?).
    - Run: Move 2 spaces, but auto-alert bees.
    - Look: player.accuracy_bonus += 1 (stackable, but notes say remove on hit?).
    - Attack: Check range (dist <= weapon.range). Roll: roll := rand.int31_max(10, &state.rng) + 1 (d10). If roll >= (weapon.accuracy_base + player.accuracy_bonus), hit: Apply damage (modified by bee is_flying/grounded). If hit, bee hp -= dmg; if <=0, remove bee. Alert bee. Reset accuracy_bonus? (per notes: remove looks on hit).
    - Dodge: Prep bonus vs bee sting.
    - After action: Check if player wins (all bees dead).
3. **Bee Turn** (for each bee):
    
    - Draw cards: N based on personality (2 for aggressive, 1 for defensive).
        - drawn := slice.clone(state.bee_deck[:num_draws]); state.bee_deck = state.bee_deck[num_draws:] (or reshuffle if empty? Notes debate mandatory reshuffle).
    - Choose action: Based on personality.
        - Aggressive: Prefer actions with "Toward" or Sting.
        - Defensive: Prefer "Away" or Dodge.
        - If alerted, prioritize Sting.
        - Use a scoring func: e.g., score = if type == .FlyToward && personality == .Aggressive { 10 } else { 0 }
        - Pick max score, or rand if tie.
    - Execute:
        - Move: Update position toward/away from player (find direction: dx = sign(player.x - bee.x), etc.). Clamp to grid.
        - Sting: If alerted and dist <=1, roll attack on player: player.hp -=1 (or more). If player dodges, miss chance.
        - Idle: Nothing.
        - Set states: is_flying=true for Fly*, is_grounded=true for Crawl*.
        - Auto-alert if player attacks or too close (dist==0?).
    - Multi-bee: All bees act, possibly alert all on hit (per notes).
    - After: Check if player loses (hp <=0).
4. **Main Game Loop** (in main or engine proc):
    
    odin
    
    `   main :: proc() {  state := init_game()  for state.player.hp > 0 && state.num_bees > 0 {  // Player turn: Simulate or input  player_action := PlayerAction{ .Move, {1,0}, nil } // Example  execute_player_action(&state, player_action)  if all_bees_dead(&state) { advance_level(&state); continue }  // Bee turns  for &bee in state.bees[:state.num_bees] {  execute_bee_turn(&state, &bee)  }  if state.player.hp <= 0 { fmt.println("Player loses!"); break }  state.turn += 1  }  if state.player.hp > 0 { fmt.println("Player wins!") }  }       `
    
    - execute_player_action: Switch on type, update state.
    - execute_bee_turn: Draw, choose, execute.
    - advance_level: Increase num_bees, respawn, more weapons, etc.
    - all_bees_dead: Loop check hp <=0.
5. **Additional Rules/Flow Notes**:
    
    - Alert: Set on player attack or close (dist<=1?). Resets? (Notes: Make remove looks more frequently).
    - Reshuffle: Optional per notes; if deck empty, state.bee_deck = init_bee_deck() if mandatory.
    - Multiplayer: Add more players as Characters, trading? (Future: Add queue for turns).
    - Levels: Level 2+ = more bees (1 aggressive, 1 defensive), grid same.
    - Improvements: Bee more forward moves (weight deck), remove OP weapons or nerf.
    - Edge Cases: Bee can't move closer if dist==0; player on bee tile = auto attack/sting?
    - Random: Use state.rng for all rolls/shuffles.
    - Win/Lose: Track wins as in notes (Me, Bee, etc.).

This is a solid starting point. Implement the execute procs with switches, and test with your sample playthrough (e.g., simulate moves and draws). If you need full code for a proc or expansions (like multiplayer), let me know!

Thanks! Here's some notes I"ve been taking for how I want ot start developing this game. look at the last part about rules engine, that's what you've helped out on. Can you think of some high level epics ansd some lower level stories and finally some tasks I can start working on to develop all this and do it in order of dependencies?

Thought for 7s

No response.

## As a Player I'd like to start up the game and close it

#### Discussion:

- Since this will be for a demo, I'd like the start up screen to remain on at all times
- aka pressing esc doesn't shut down but just goes to the main screen
- So there should be a main screen that's just like... Start Game, Exit etc....
- No need for mouse controls just wasd
- Keep in mind that the way your engine is structured you need some data to be loaded in the gpu at all times
- but others can be revamped
- So yeah you'll need to get your gui system working
- but also have some
- ... no just show a simple texture with a PRESS SPACE TO PLAy kind of thing
- maybe hold esc for 2 seconds to close as well

## As a Player, I'd like a beginning and end to the game

#### Discussion:

- So as said before, keep in mind the structure of your engine
- There should be something like a state machine that has a:

1. Start
2. Play
3. Pause
4. End

- Start loads a scene and all assets in a predefined order and sets off any rngs objects etc...
- Play runs the timer does all the gamey stuff
- Pause stops everything and plops a pause screen on the thing
- End Shuts down the scene and plops a main menu screen, probably some resuable code from pause

## As a Gamer in Play mode, I'd like to move around a grid

#### Discussion:

- As a first pass... just use a cube, please resist the temptation to use anything other than a cube
- nvm a sphere might be better
- nvm... you have a prefab system it literally doesn't matter
- unless you need to use that debug cube
- also physics isn't that important in a grid, you can possibly remove the physics system?
- Maybe let it stay if it's not bothersome and
- oh gravity is definitely useful
- but maybe let it stay just incause you wanna swatch
- So basically what you want is a system that smoothly transitions your character from one block to another
- WASD-Only
- 1 cube at a time
- you might have to make some kind of state machine that triggers some kind of overarching game structure that lets you know you've taken a single step
- Make sure there's bounds checking
- make sure there's some kind of structure that lets you know the [x,y] of the grid at all times
- make sure you're always in the center of that square?

## As a Gamer in Play mode, I'd like an enemy to move around a grid

#### Discussion:

- So yeah it seems like an overarching game machine will be necessary
- For this epic you just want to make the a.i.... hmmm
- if you structure your player code correctly.... you can just reuse the same make_thing_go_to_square function
- this will probably just use an RNG to go to some... ohhhh actually...
- so the difference here si that the player can invalidly attempt to go to a square
- while the bee MUST go to a valid square
- so there will be bounds checking to see where the next valid square is
- so the main ask for this is a go to a valid square function
- but tbh you can probably do more...
- A* pathfinding shouldn't be too difficult in a 7x7 grid
- But then this begs the question of... should there be a previous story about how the grid operates?

## As a Gamer in Play Mode, I'd like a grid system

#### Discussion:

- So yeah there should be a grid system that starts off as being 7x7...
- is there any reason it needs a limit? like does that NEEd TO BE hard coded? will it be that much of an effort to make it dynamic?
- it should probs be dynamic from the start
- So at Start game: set the grid min-max
- The grid will be a 2x2 data structure that keeps track of all objects inside it
- There should be an update_grid(x,y) function that plops a thing on the grid
- The grid should be able to have walls
- idk I think that's it for now?

## As a Gamer in Play Mode, I'd like to be able to attack the bee

#### Discussion:

- is_in_range_of_bee::proc() -> bool
- if true, allow attack to happen
- if attack, kill bee
- bee is deleted
- overarching game system knows a bee has been elimitated
- if all bee's in level is destroyed, victory == true
- if victory, display you win screen and set state back to main menu or allow next level progression

## As a Gamer in Play Mode, I'd like to be attacked by the bee

#### Discussion:

- is_in_range_of_player::proc() -> bool
- is_alerted == true?
- Attack player
- overarching game system knows player is dead etc...
- reset level since lost
- display YOU DEAD BRO

## As a Designer, I'd like an overall rules engine

#### Discussion:

- Right now you're just looking at things as just like...
- Player v bee and then just adding rules as you go
- But you need to first decide on all the rules from the get go
- and then plop those characters in as needed
- So first decide on all the rules
- then structure the code around all those rules
- then place the charcters inside those rules
- the rules engine is that overarching game system
- [[Bee Ideas#Mechanics]]
- The rules engine could be the entire game itself, in text form
- So like...
- Start game: Player is at 3,0, bee is at 3,6
- Current Turn: player
- Player is at 31, player has no weapon player picks up weapon player blah blah blah
- So yeah that's the game then thats the main game loop
- this should be done before any kind of visual anything
- so now just play the game and write doen the rules as you go

  oops, here's the thing

Thought for 2m 24s

### High-Level Epics

Epics are the major feature groups, derived from your user stories. I've organized them to capture the core themes: foundational rules and simulation (text-based first, as per your notes), grid and movement mechanics, combat, game states/lifecycle, and visuals/UI. This ensures we build a playable core before adding polish.

1. **Epic: Rules Engine Core** Establish a text-based simulation of the game rules, mechanics, and logic without visuals. This acts as the "overarching game system" you mentioned, allowing rule validation via console playthroughs before integrating graphics.
2. **Epic: Grid System** Implement a dynamic grid to manage positions, objects, and bounds, serving as the spatial foundation for movement and interactions.
3. **Epic: Character Movement** Handle player and enemy (bee) movement on the grid, including validation, pathing, and state tracking.
4. **Epic: Combat Mechanics** Add attack logic for player vs. bee and bee vs. player, integrating range checks, alerts, and win/loss conditions.
5. **Epic: Game Lifecycle and States** Manage the overall game flow with a state machine for start, play, pause, end, including menus and resets.
6. **Epic: Visuals and UI Integration** Layer graphical elements (e.g., cubes/spheres for entities, textures for menus) on top of the core logic, using Odin's GPU/asset loading (assuming a library like Raylib for rendering).

### Lower-Level Stories

Stories break down epics into user-focused deliverables. I've mapped them directly to your "As a [Role], I'd like [Feature]" notes, grouping under epics.

#### Epic: Rules Engine Core

- **Story: As a Designer, I'd like an overall rules engine** Create a text-based engine that simulates the full game loop, including turns, actions, and rules from your notes (e.g., player starts at [0,2], bee at [6,2]; player acts first; bee draws cards).

#### Epic: Grid System

- **Story: As a Gamer in Play Mode, I'd like a grid system** Build a dynamic 2D grid structure to track positions, objects (e.g., weapons, walls), and provide functions for updates and queries.

#### Epic: Character Movement

- **Story: As a Gamer in Play Mode, I'd like to move around a grid** Enable player movement with WASD, single-step transitions, bounds checking, and centering on grid cells.
- **Story: As a Gamer in Play Mode, I'd like an enemy to move around a grid** Implement bee movement using reusable logic from player movement, with AI-driven valid moves (e.g., RNG or A* for toward/away).

#### Epic: Combat Mechanics

- **Story: As a Gamer in Play Mode, I'd like to be able to attack the bee** Add player attack logic, including range checks, hit resolution, bee elimination, and victory conditions.
- **Story: As a Gamer in Play Mode, I'd like to be attacked by the bee** Add bee attack logic, including alert triggers, range checks, player damage, and loss conditions.

#### Epic: Game Lifecycle and States

- **Story: As a Player, I'd like to start up the game and close it** Create a main menu screen with options (Start Game, Exit), persistent until explicit close (e.g., hold ESC for 2s).
- **Story: As a Player, I'd like a beginning and end to the game** Implement a state machine for Start (load assets/scenes), Play (run game), Pause (overlay screen), End (reset to menu).

#### Epic: Visuals and UI Integration

- (No direct story from your notes, but implied in discussions about cubes, spheres, textures, GPU loading, and prefabs. This epic integrates visuals once core logic is solid.)

### Tasks in Order of Dependencies

Tasks are actionable, bite-sized steps. I've ordered the entire list by dependencies: Start with rules engine (text-only) to validate logic, then add grid/movement/combat in console mode, then lifecycle, and finally visuals. This follows your note to "do this before any kind of visual anything" and "play the game and write down the rules as you go." Assume Odin basics (structs, procs) from previous outline; use console I/O for early testing (e.g., fmt.println for simulation).

#### Tasks for Epic: Rules Engine Core

1. Define core game rules in code: Expand the GameState struct from previous outline to include all mechanics (e.g., turns, alerted state, victory/loss flags). Write a proc to simulate a full turn cycle (player action, then bee actions) in text.
2. Implement text-based input/output: Create a console loop in main() to prompt for player actions (e.g., "Enter move: W/A/S/D" or "Attack? Y/N") and print game state (e.g., "Player at [0,2], Bee at [6,2]").
3. Simulate sample playthrough: Hardcode a test run matching your sample (e.g., player moves to [1,2], bee draws cards and does nothing). Run and debug to refine rules (e.g., add reshuffle logic if deck empty).
4. Iterate on rules: Play 5-10 text games, logging wins/losses (as in your notes: Me, Bee, etc.), and adjust deck weights/behaviors (e.g., more forward moves for bees).

#### Tasks for Epic: Grid System (Depends on Rules Engine Core)

5. Implement dynamic grid: In GameState, use a dynamic 2D slice ([][]Tile) with init proc to set size (e.g., from constants, but allow params for dynamic). Add procs: update_position(entity: ^Character, new_pos: Vec2i) with bounds checking.
6. Add grid objects: Extend Tile struct to support weapons and walls. Write placement proc (e.g., random_weapons(num: int)).
7. Add query procs: Implement get_tile(pos: Vec2i) -> ^Tile, is_valid_pos(pos: Vec2i) -> bool (bounds + no wall), get_entities_at(pos: Vec2i) -> []^Character.
8. Integrate with rules engine: Update text simulation to use grid for positions (e.g., print grid as ASCII art: P for player, B for bee, W for weapon).

#### Tasks for Epic: Character Movement (Depends on Grid System)

9. Implement basic movement proc: Create move_to(entity: ^Character, direction: Vec2i) -> bool (calculate new_pos, check valid, update if yes; return success).
10. Add player-specific movement: In player turn, map WASD to directions ({0,-1} for W/up, etc.). Handle invalid moves (e.g., print "Can't move there").
11. Add bee movement logic: Extend BeeAction execution to use move_to (e.g., for FlyToward: find direction toward player, move up to 2 steps if valid).
12. Add pathfinding basics: Implement simple A* or BFS for bee moves (use a proc find_path(start, goal: Vec2i) -> []Vec2i; grid small, so efficient). Use for "toward" actions.
13. Test movement in text: Simulate moves (e.g., player W to new pos, bee toward 2 steps), print updated grid.

#### Tasks for Epic: Combat Mechanics (Depends on Character Movement)

14. Implement range checks: Add is_in_range(attacker, target: ^Character, range: i32) -> bool (using distance proc).
15. Add player attack: In player turn, if in range and has weapon, roll hit (rand), apply damage, alert bee, check victory (all bees hp <=0).
16. Add bee attack: In bee turn, if alerted and in range, roll sting (or auto if simple), damage player, check loss (player hp <=0).
17. Handle eliminations: Add remove_bee(index: int) to shift array. On victory/loss, set flags in GameState.
18. Test combat in text: Simulate attacks (e.g., player attacks, hits, bee dies; or bee stings player to 0 hp), log outcomes.

#### Tasks for Epic: Game Lifecycle and States (Depends on Combat Mechanics)

19. Implement state machine: Add GameMode enum (Start, Play, Pause, End) to GameState. Write switch-based update proc (e.g., in main loop: switch mode { case .Play: handle_turn() }).
20. Add start/end logic: On Start, load/init GameState (rng seed, assets placeholders). On End, reset to menu (print "You Win/Lose! Back to menu").
21. Add pause: On ESC (simulate in text with input), switch to Pause, print pause menu, resume on input.
22. Add close logic: In main loop, check for "hold ESC 2s" (use time.since or simulate), exit program.
23. Add main menu: In Start/End, print options (Start Game, Exit), handle input to transition (e.g., space to Play).
24. Integrate full lifecycle: Run text game from menu -> play -> win/lose -> back to menu.

#### Tasks for Epic: Visuals and UI Integration (Depends on Game Lifecycle)

25. Set up rendering library: Import Odin bindings for Raylib (or similar; assume you have it). Add GPU init in Start (e.g., rl.InitWindow, load textures).
26. Render grid visually: In Play update, draw grid as lines/tiles; use cubes or spheres for entities (e.g., rl.DrawCube for player/bee positions, scaled to grid cells).
27. Add smooth transitions: For movements, use lerping (math.lerp position over time) in update proc.
28. Render menus/UI: In Start/Pause/End, draw textures (e.g., simple "PRESS SPACE TO PLAY" image) or text (rl.DrawText).
29. Handle input for visuals: Replace text input with rl.IsKeyPressed (e.g., KEY_W for up).
30. Add physics if needed: Integrate simple gravity/collisions (e.g., using Odin's physics lib or custom; optional per your notes).
31. Optimize asset loading: Load persistent assets (e.g., menu textures) once at program start; reload level-specific in Start.
32. Test full game: Run visual version, ensure rules engine drives visuals (e.g., bee move updates model position).
33. Polish: Add hold-ESC timer for exit, ensure no mouse needed (WASD only).
