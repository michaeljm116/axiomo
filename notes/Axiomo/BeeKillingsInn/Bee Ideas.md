## Rules
* You start off seeing the bee



## Improvements
* Make bee's remove looks more frequently
* Mutiplyaer, especially for the card portion
* Move movement
* Maybe make a treasure chest with a 
* Let the bee go first
	* more fun started happening when that happened



### Your 10 games
* There's no point in keeping multiple runs
* double runs are kinda dumb tbh
* the bee doing nothing is kinda boring
	* but it does capture the reality of prepping to kill a bee
* sneak move 1' are always a must
* It's fun when movement is happening
* you were confident when you had a very good card
* Bug Spray with multi dodges is fun!
* Electric swatter is op
	* electric swatter always leads to runs
* Yo that fly swatter oh man that game was intense
	* there was like a mixture of so many strategies to employ and realizing you made the wrong decision
	* that bee moving away and destroying your spacing o man...
* You got rid of the shoe and went with the swatter... despite the fact that if you have multi dodges... the shoe would have been a good strat tooo...
* Kinda boring game after... 
	* you assembled a shoe withi a look +2 and then was like k got everything time to move and yeah just not so interesting even tho t echnically you had a good chance of dying if the shoe missed
* The problem with run is... you only use that when you know you're going to run and kill the bee
	* actually that might be an okay thing....  it's like a combo card of sorts that makes it so if you attak you only attack once per turn
* it's just.. dumb to alert the bee before an attack and thats why you keep winning
* 


## Ideas
* multi bee turns
* muti player
* remove elec swat or more focus on weap strats
* bee needs more move forwards, more of that than backwards
* fly twoard shoudl be UP to 2 closer
* 
#### Wins
Me, Be, Me, Me, Me, 
Me, Me, Me, Me, Me


## Bee + 2 cards see 
#### Aggressive
* movement is more fun
* player strategy changes to be more defensive
* 2nd win was purely luck you should have died... unless...
	* technically it wasn't luck since you strategized you'd have less stings
	* should resuffling be mandatory?
	* i think it makes it more strategic to not reshufflie
	* running on aggressive bees is useless might as well stay still and build up
* Auto alert when on top is gr8
* The grounds only are kinda boring... you should do something more like... 8 on ground 10 on air or something

Wins: me, me, me, bee, me


## 2 Bees, each 1 card based on personality
1 aggressive, 1 defensive

bee, bee

## 3 bees, 2 players
1 aggressive, 1 lazy, 1 other
* trading?
* should all bees be alerted?
* remove looks upon hit?
	* + 2 must remove
* weapon on hand?
* equip weapon = 1 turn?
* overall... game is longer, less exciting, more everything
* aggressive bee is fun tho... like the beginning is fun
* maybe making players life harder is more fun
	* equip = 1 turn
	* no trading
	* remove looks upon hit
	* rename look to focus
	* all bees get alerted


## Grid Bee
* The worst part about the previous game was there not being much movement
	* so now that's solved
* another problem was no uses for run until the end
	* with line of sight that can be solved
	* this also adds more strat
* I think I'm liking it so far
	* issue is... it seems less.. fun?
* That part where you're constantly wondering what move the bee will make next is...
	* fun! 
	* on edge!
* One thing is though... it's like... too.... balanced
	* actually nvm you can't say that
	* balance is good but it just... doesn't let you feel POWERFUL
	* And then its like... okay you have a 50% chance of killing 1 bee.. what aobut 2?
		* impossible!
		* maybe make it so that if you kill 1 bee you level up your weapon
	* but honestly... you haven't really tested out 2 players yet
* In the mean time... tech wise... i think a grid is a go!
	* i wish i can odin this but...
	* like honestly it's disgusting
