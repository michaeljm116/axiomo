* Contrasting Colors: must have contrasting color to make things easy to see
* Intuitive Design: how easy and simple to make for a user. use user's intuition
* Visual Hierarchy: Guiding a user's eye to the most important thing
* ResearchResearchResearch!
* Give gamers reminders of mechanics
* Fewest necessary actions
* Consistency
* Responsiveness
* Intention - Motions draw players eye to target
* Awareness - elements respond to location
* Consistency - Repeated patterns
* Physical Intuition - Maybe have a fly swatter on the menu?
