Old church turned into an Inn
demon posessed bees
used to be a live church but then sin crept in wasn't dealth with no excommunications and eventuallyw hithered into an empty building until someone had the idea to turn the church into an inn. Howver the spirit of those sins crept up into an secret bee hive down in its basement 
you have to work your way through all the rooms discover the mysteries and destroy the hive before it spreads to more hotels
