Long ago, a once thriving Church was the target of evil forces. The minister of that church soon fell in to adultery and all kinds of sins, the elders refused to dipose the minister due to his celebrity status etc etc  but eventually the husband of the mistress murdered the minister. The church shrunk eventually died but the building was kept in tact.  One day a guy who was a Bee collector visited the church building there fell sick and died, people thought the building was haunted and someone performed an exorcism there and due to a slip in language, sent the evil spirits in to the Bees. Decades later, some investors wanted to convert the church into an Inn. But construction was halted after several strange death involving bee's occurred. You are an investigator sent to uncover the mystery of these bee related deaths while also trying to kill off these hordes of violent bees.
