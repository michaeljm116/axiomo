* Soooo final fantasy ui seems to be pretty... non thematic for such a thematic game like you can literally just do simple square boxes and it'd be fine
* The Best game UI is one that gives the most amount of relevant information in the simplest shortest time
* But the key to a good UI is also.... players not noticing it exists so you have to keep that tension in mind
* you love minimal ul and cinematic feelz but thats apparently not for everyone
* But ultimately, everything depends on your final game design
* like first you need to plot out every mechanic every... thing and then design the UI around all the info
* .... I think?
* So should you go back to the card game?
* Yeah keep refining the card game so that it captures that emotion

	* Focus/Dodge meter only on bee
	* weapon/pic and stats
* Bee
	* Health
	* Flying/Crawling
