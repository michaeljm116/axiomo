* Summary, there ought to be a way to easily see what the grid looks like, as well as any other important data visually this is useful both for debugging and gameplay purposes
* Thoughts:
	* There is a question of how do you want it to look...
		* wireframe vs filled in
		* If wireframe you can take advantage of what you've done with the bvh maybe
		* or just 2d planee
		* well regardless this will be a 2d plane
		* but then its like... do you want them to be like a bunch of planes or a lil bit
		* So #1 you want info clearly communicated... first... find what you like then find what you dont like and see why
		* okay so you dont like it when its "too loud"
		* For some reason i really like the visuals on this abut the more i think the mnore i might not
		* ![[tales-tactics.avif]]
		* This is perf: It's liek the grid perfectly matches the game style:
		  ![[09_Capes.webp]]
		* ![[05_Clash2.webp]]
		* This is also perfect an in step with what you want
		* So I think the fact that you are in a hotel with tiles can play in to how you design the final look of the grid
		* but you're also gettting too in to design the fact is right now you need communication
	* So straight up you should use your bvh thing for quick comms
