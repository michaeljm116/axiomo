# How much do you want to make?
* 20$ per hour, for 1000 hours aka 20k
* 310 days a year =  3+ hours per day
* if you price it at 20k then thats....
	* 1000 copies at $20... not possible
	* 2000 copies at $10... more reasonable
	* 3000 copies at $7.49.... hmmmm
	* im thinking.... 1000 copies at 10 
		* Remaining = sales + legs
# Tactical Small Game
* What kind of reusable tech will this current game have?
* DODGE mechanic will be in the works
* WASD if you have an overworld
* Tiling, Grid system
* This will be the first game on axiomo so.... yeah so much
* The animations will be a major bonus if u get that working

# Marketing
* Honestly.... I can't think of one... im very new to this genre idk how to appeal to them at all and i doubt ill be the best at anything
* I guess gameplaywise I'm hoping for FFT + E33 idk how to get into their minds though
* I have to do hardcore expectations on the alone-ness part of it, i don't want them thinking you can control multiple characters or have a ton of expectations about that
* This works perfect for your genre you want like modern mideval

## Attention Magnets
* Imagine FFT with the dodge of E33!
* Ever find a bee in your house and you know you need to drop everything and kill it immediately before it becomes a problem? That's this game
* People's eye's did seem to spark when I mentioned that idea

## Marketing
* Get a press kit,
* An Email List
* Business aand website of game
* FB page
* discord
* honestly i'd like a vertical slice first
* The least ammount of clicks to get someone to follow you the better!
*
